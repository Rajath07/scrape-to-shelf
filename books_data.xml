After high school, Cassie ran away from home to marry the wrong man, throwing away a college scholarship and breaking her parents&#8217; hearts. To make matters worse, Cassie had always been their father&#8217;s favorite -- a sentiment that weighed heavily on her sisters and made Cassie&#8217;s actions even harder to bear.Now thirty-one, Cassie is back in Washington, living in Seattle with her daughter and hoping to leave her past behind. After ending a difficult marriage, Cassie is back on her own two feet, the pieces of her life slowly but surely coming together. Despite the strides Cassie&#8217;s made, she hasn&#8217;t been able to make peace with her sisters. Karen, the oldest, is a busy wife and mother, balancing her career with raising her two children. And Nichole, the youngest, is a stay-at-home mom whose husband indulges her every whim. Then one day, Cassie receives a letter from Karen, offering what Cassie thinks may be a chance to reconcile. And as Cassie opens herself up to new possibilities -- making amends with her sisters, finding love once more -- she realizes the power of compassion, and the promise of a fresh start. ...more</description><upc>07e6810fd3236bda</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>59.98</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>59.98</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Fiction</category><star_rating>Three</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b789a</_id><title>Civilization and Its Discontents</title><price>59.95</price><availability>In stock (3 available)</availability><description>It stands as a brilliant summary of the views on culture from a psychoanalytic perspective that he had been developing since the turn of the century.

It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mind&#8212;the so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros.Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of James Strachey.Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Edition in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions. ...more</description><upc>396385e3de5d18c3</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>59.95</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>59.95</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Psychology</category><star_rating>Two</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b776e</_id><title>The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook</title><price>59.92</price><availability>In stock (6 available)</availability><description>For more than twenty years, Barefoot Contessa, the acclaimed specialty food store, has been cooking and baking extraordinary dishes for enthusiastic customers in the Hamptons.

For many of those years, people have tried to get the exuberant owner, Ina Garten, to share the secrets of her store. Finally, the energy and style that make Barefoot Contessa such a special place are shown here, with dozens of recipes and more than 160 breathtaking photographs, in The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook.Ina's most popular recipes use familiar ingredients, but they taste even better than you would expect. Her Pan-Fried Onion Dip is the real thing, with slowly car-amelized onions and fresh sour cream. Tomato soup is created from oven-roasted tomatoes and fresh basil to intensify the flavors. Meat loaf is as good as your grandmother's, but it's healthier because it's made with ground turkey and fresh herbs. The light and flaky Maple-Oatmeal Scones are baked with rolled oats, whole wheat, and real maple syrup. Now these and other famous Barefoot Contessa recipes can be prepared at home.Ina says that before she owned a specialty food store she often spent a week making dinner for six friends. Her experience at Barefoot Contessa has given her hundreds of ideas for creating wonderful parties in a few hours. And they're all in this book. Crab Cakes with R&#233;moulade Sauce can be stored overnight in the refrigerator and saut&#233;ed just before the guests arrive. Cheddar Corn Chowder can be made days ahead, reheated, and served with a salad and bread for a delicious autumn lunch. The ingredients for Grilled Salmon Salad can all be prepared ahead and tossed together before serving. The batter for the Raspberry Corn Muffins can be mixed a day before and popped into the oven just before breakfast.Ina Garten teaches us how to entertain with style, simplicity, and a relaxed sense of fun. There are notes throughout the book for giving cocktail parties, lunches, and dinner parties where everything is done before the guests arrive. And there are easy instructions for creating gorgeous party platters that don't even require you to cook!With Ina Garten and The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook, you have the perfect recipe for hosting parties that are easy and fun for everyone--including the cook. ...more</description><upc>6478ccb4416e6a5d</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>59.92</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>59.92</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Food and Drink</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b76ac</_id><title>The Diary of a Young Girl</title><price>59.9</price><availability>In stock (12 available)</availability><description>Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank's remarkable diary has since become a world classic&#8212;a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit.In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding.

For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the "Secret Annexe" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death.In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and amusing, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short. ...more</description><upc>54fc03f1e1d355db</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>59.9</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>59.9</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Nonfiction</category><star_rating>Three</star_rating></Book></TopExpensiveBooks><CategoryCounts><Category><_id>Default</_id><count>152</count></Category><Category><_id>Nonfiction</_id><count>110</count></Category><Category><_id>Sequential Art</_id><count>75</count></Category><Category><_id>Add a comment</_id><count>67</count></Category><Category><_id>Fiction</_id><count>65</count></Category><Category><_id>Young Adult</_id><count>54</count></Category><Category><_id>Fantasy</_id><count>48</count></Category><Category><_id>Romance</_id><count>35</count></Category><Category><_id>Mystery</_id><count>32</count></Category><Category><_id>Food and Drink</_id><count>30</count></Category><Category><_id>Childrens</_id><count>29</count></Category><Category><_id>Historical Fiction</_id><count>26</count></Category><Category><_id>Classics</_id><count>19</count></Category><Category><_id>Poetry</_id><count>19</count></Category><Category><_id>History</_id><count>18</count></Category><Category><_id>Horror</_id><count>17</count></Category><Category><_id>Womens Fiction</_id><count>17</count></Category><Category><_id>Science Fiction</_id><count>16</count></Category><Category><_id>Science</_id><count>14</count></Category><Category><_id>Music</_id><count>13</count></Category><Category><_id>Business</_id><count>12</count></Category><Category><_id>Travel</_id><count>11</count></Category><Category><_id>Philosophy</_id><count>11</count></Category><Category><_id>Thriller</_id><count>11</count></Category><Category><_id>Humor</_id><count>10</count></Category><Category><_id>Autobiography</_id><count>9</count></Category><Category><_id>Art</_id><count>8</count></Category><Category><_id>Psychology</_id><count>7</count></Category><Category><_id>Religion</_id><count>7</count></Category><Category><_id>New Adult</_id><count>6</count></Category><Category><_id>Christian Fiction</_id><count>6</count></Category><Category><_id>Spirituality</_id><count>6</count></Category><Category><_id>Biography</_id><count>5</count></Category><Category><_id>Sports and Games</_id><count>5</count></Category><Category><_id>Self Help</_id><count>5</count></Category><Category><_id>Health</_id><count>4</count></Category><Category><_id>Politics</_id><count>3</count></Category><Category><_id>Contemporary</_id><count>3</count></Category><Category><_id>Christian</_id><count>3</count></Category><Category><_id>Historical</_id><count>2</count></Category><Category><_id>Paranormal</_id><count>1</count></Category><Category><_id>Adult Fiction</_id><count>1</count></Category><Category><_id>Erotica</_id><count>1</count></Category><Category><_id>Parenting</_id><count>1</count></Category><Category><_id>Crime</_id><count>1</count></Category><Category><_id>Novels</_id><count>1</count></Category><Category><_id>Cultural</_id><count>1</count></Category><Category><_id>Short Stories</_id><count>1</count></Category><Category><_id>Academic</_id><count>1</count></Category><Category><_id>Suspense</_id><count>1</count></Category></CategoryCounts><AveragePriceByStarRating><StarRating><_id>Five</_id><average_price>35.374489795918365</average_price></StarRating><StarRating><_id>Four</_id><average_price>36.093296089385476</average_price></StarRating><StarRating><_id>One</_id><average_price>34.56119469026549</average_price></StarRating><StarRating><_id>Three</_id><average_price>34.6920197044335</average_price></StarRating><StarRating><_id>Two</_id><average_price>34.810918367346936</average_price></StarRating></AveragePriceByStarRating><LowestPriceBooks><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b77bc</_id><title>An Abundance of Katherines</title><price>10.0</price><availability>In stock (5 available)</availability><description>Katherine V thought boys were gross Katherine X just wanted to be friends Katherine XVIII dumped him in an e-mail K-19 broke his heart When it comes to relationships, Colin Singleton's type happens to be girls named Katherine.

The volume had taken Darwin more than twenty years to publish, in part because he envisioned the storm of controversy it was certain to unleash. Indeed, selling out its first edition on its first day, The Origin of Species revolutionized science, philosophy, and theology.Darwin&#8217;s reasoned, documented arguments carefully advance his theory of natural selection and his assertion that species were not created all at once by a divine hand but started with a few simple forms that mutated and adapted over time. Whether commenting on his own poor health, discussing his experiments to test instinct in bees, or relating a conversation about a South American burrowing rodent, Darwin&#8217;s monumental achievement is surprisingly personal and delightfully readable. Its profound ideas remain controversial even today, making it the most influential book in the natural sciences ever written&#8212;an important work not just to its time but to the history of humankind. ...more</description><upc>0345872b14f9e774</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>10.01</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>10.01</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Science</category><star_rating>Four</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b780a</_id><title>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</title><price>10.02</price><availability>In stock (3 available)</availability><description>The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire.

In "Greek Mythic History," he weaves myths concerning gods, kings, and heroes into their intended time and place and offers a concise retelling of Greek myths from a historic perspective. Capitalizing on modern discoveries, Clevenger tells the story in chronological order, starting with the creation of the cosmos and ending in the Dark Ages when poets began to write down their myths and stories. Neither history nor mythology, the stories depict what history might be if the myths were interpreted more literally.With maps and exhibits included, "Greek Mythic History" provides a comprehensive retelling of the various Hellenic myths in a logical historical sequence, and places nearly the entire canon into context. ...more</description><upc>f201f263d8c23f97</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>10.23</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>10.23</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Default</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book></LowestPriceBooks><PriceRanges><Range><range>&lt;10</range><count>0</count></Range><Range><range>10-20</range><count>196</count></Range><Range><range>20-50</range><count>606</count></Range><Range><range>&gt;50</range><count>198</count></Range></PriceRanges><FiveStarBooks><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b7542</_id><title>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</title><price>54.23</price><availability>In stock (20 available)</availability><description>From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity&#8217;s creation and evolution&#8212;a #1 international bestseller&#8212;that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be &#8220;human.&#8221;One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth.

Yet today there is only one&#8212;homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem. ...more</description><upc>4165285e1663650f</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>54.23</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>54.23</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>History</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b754a</_id><title>Set Me Free</title><price>17.46</price><availability>In stock (19 available)</availability><description>Aaron Ledbetter&#8217;s future had been planned out for him since before he was born.

They will live in an apartment on campus with Charlie, a young chimp abandoned by his mother. The Freemans were selected for the experiment because they know sign language; they are supposed to teach it to Charlie and welcome him as a member of their family.

Though Metchnikoff was largely forgotten for nearly a hundred years, Vikhanski documents a remarkable revival of interest in his ideas on immunity and on the gut flora in the science of the twenty-first century. ...more</description><upc>e4f74c16de34d440</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>57.36</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>57.36</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Science</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b75b1</_id><title>Call the Nurse: True Stories of a Country Nurse on a Scottish Isle</title><price>29.14</price><availability>In stock (16 available)</availability><description>Tired of the pace and noise of life near London and longing for a better place to raise their young children, Mary J.

MacLeod and her husband encountered their dream while vacationing on a remote island in the Scottish Hebrides. Enthralled by its windswept beauty, they soon were the proud owners of a near-derelict croft house--a farmer's stone cottage--on "a small acre" of land. Mary assumed duties as the island's district nurse. Call the Nurse is her account of the enchanted years she and her family spent there, coming to know its folk as both patients and friends.In anecdotes that are by turns funny, sad, moving, and tragic, she recalls them all, the crofters and their laird, the boatmen and tradesmen, young lovers and forbidding churchmen. Against the old-fashioned island culture and the grandeur of mountain and sea unfold indelible stories: a young woman carried through snow for airlift to the hospital; a rescue by boat; the marriage of a gentle giant and the island beauty; a ghostly encounter; the shocking discovery of a woman in chains; the flames of a heather fire at night; an unexploded bomb from World War II; and the joyful, tipsy celebration of a ceilidh. Gaelic fortitude meets a nurse's compassion in these wonderful true stories from rural Scotland. ...more</description><upc>bee3672891cca906</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>29.14</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>29.14</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Nonfiction</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b75b8</_id><title>A Piece of Sky, a Grain of Rice: A Memoir in Four Meditations</title><price>56.76</price><availability>In stock (16 available)</availability><description>In this layered collage of memory within memory, Hale recreates for readers her kaleidoscopic experience of a decades-long journey to acceptance and insight.

Writer, prodigal daughter, single parent, Buddhist disciple, and, late in midlife, a newlywed, she is transformed through an unconventional relationship with a female spiritual teacher and an odd ritual of repeated tattooing with her two young adult children. "Christine Hale's evocation of the bewildering complexities of life as a mother, daughter, wife (and ex-wife), and student of Buddhism is both a poem and a letter to those she has worked so long and hard to understand. On a journey that takes her through emotional and actual hurricanes, love and cruelty, urgent losses, and painful gains, she climbs to sometimes unnervingly high altitudes as she experiences "the joy and the sorrow of samsara." In beautiful, clear language, Hale explores the wounds life gives us, the wounds we give ourselves, and the long process of healing." -Sarah Stone, author of The True Sources of the Nile Christine Hale is the author of a novel, Basil's Dream (Livingston Press 2009); National Book Award finalist Joan Silber says, "Basil's Dream...seems to prove fiction can go where other forms can't." Ms. Hale's creative nonfiction has appeared in Arts &amp; Letters, Spry, Still, Hippocampus, and Prime Number, among other journals. A fellow of MacDowell, Ucross, Hedgebrook, and the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, she earned her MFA from Warren Wilson College.

Identity shattered, enlisted in the British army, William trains with Loyalist refugees eager to annihilate the rebels who forced them into exile. Coming to terms with who and what he is proves impossible, but if he breaks his Loyalist oath, he'll be no better than the man who constructed his life of lies.Not Anna, Reginald's adopted daughter, nor Two Hawks, William's twin, both who long for Reginald to accept their love despite the challenges they will face, building a marriage that bridges two cultures.

We feel unqualified to do God&#8217;s work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good. In fact, God loves unqualified people.In (Un)Qualified, Who You Think You Are is Not as Important as Who God Says You AreMany of us wrestle with the gap between our weaknesses and our dreams, between who we are and who God says we are meant to be. We feel unqualified to do God&#8217;s work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good. In fact, God loves unqualified people.In (Un)Qualified, Pastor Steven Furtick helps you peel back the assumptions you&#8217;ve made about yourself and see yourself as God sees you. Because true peace and confidence come not from worldly perfection but from acceptance: God&#8217;s acceptance of you, your acceptance of yourself, and your acceptance of God&#8217;s process of change.This is a book about understanding your identity in light of who God is. It&#8217;s a book about coming to terms with the good, the bad, and the unmentionable in your life and learning to let God use you. It&#8217;s about charging into the gap between your present and your hopes and meeting God there. After all, God can&#8217;t bless who you pretend to be. But he longs to bless who you really are; a flawed and broken person. Good thing for us that God is in the business of using broken people to do big things. Being Unqualified Is God&#8217;s Favorite QualificationOur culture tells us that the answer to our failures is to fix them. The solution to our weaknesses is to hide them. The secret to our success is to appear as flawless as possible. But God&#8217;s qualifying system is different than the world&#8217;s. So is his view of our weaknesses, our purpose, and our true selves.In (Un)Qualified, Steven Furtick explores who God is as the great &#8220;I AM,&#8221; and then helps us discover our own identity. Delving into the story of Jacob, Furtick invites us to acknowledge our weaknesses and ask God to work through them.The truth is, God has created us to be more, to accomplish more, and to love life more than we ever thought possible. But to become who he has called us to be, we must embrace who we are right now. (Un)Qualified equips us to face obstacles and failures without losing a sense of purpose. We can have a thriving sense of hope that God is working in us and through us, not in spite of our weaknesses but often as a direct result of them. ...more</description><upc>e4ac92d89b946781</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>54.0</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>54.0</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Christian</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b75c8</_id><title>The Third Wave: An Entrepreneur&#8217;s Vision of the Future</title><price>12.61</price><availability>In stock (15 available)</availability><description>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of America&#8217;s most accomplished entrepreneurs&#8212;a pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of business&#8212;shares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Case&#8217;s career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of America&#8217;s most accomplished entrepreneurs&#8212;a pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of business&#8212;shares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Case&#8217;s career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in 1985. At the time, only three percent of Americans were online. It took a decade for AOL to achieve mainstream success, and there were many near-death experiences and back-to-the-wall pivots. AOL became the top performing company of the 1990s, and at its peak more than half of all consumer Internet traffic in the United States ran through the service. After Case engineered AOL&#8217;s merger with Time Warner and he became Chairman of the combined business, Case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world. In The Third Wave, which pays homage to the work of the futurist Alvin Toffler (from whom Case has borrowed the title, and whose work inspired him as a young man), Case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur, an investor, a philanthropist, and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies. We are entering, as Case explains, a new paradigm called the &#8220;Third Wave&#8221; of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leverage the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, we&#8217;re entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major &#8220;real world&#8221; sectors like health, education, transportation, energy, and food&#8212;and in the process change the way we live our daily lives. But success in the Third Wave will require a different skill set, and Case outlines the path forward.The Third Wave is part memoir, part manifesto, and part playbook for the future. With passion and clarity, Case explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies (a growing number of which, he argues, will not be based in Silicon Valley) will have to rethink their relationships with customers, with competitors, and with governments; and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategies&#8212;and how all of us can make sense of this changing digital age. ...more</description><upc>3bebf34ee9330cbd</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>12.61</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>12.61</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Business</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b75cc</_id><title>The Regional Office Is Under Attack!</title><price>51.36</price><availability>In stock (15 available)</availability><description>In a world beset by amassing forces of darkness, one organization&#8212;the Regional Office&#8212;and its coterie of super-powered female assassins protects the globe from annihilation.

This seems standard now, but it&#8217;s&#160;wildly different from what people did even just&#160;decades ago. Single people today have more&#160;romantic options than at any point in human&#160;history. With technology, our abilities to connect&#160;with and sort through these options are staggering.&#160;So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time.&#160;&#8220;Why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?&#8221;&#160;&#8220;Should I go out with this girl even though she&#160;listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods?&#160;Combos?!&#8221; &#8220;My girlfriend just got a message from&#160;some dude named Nathan.

In a short&#160;period of time, the whole culture of finding love&#160;has changed dramatically. A few decades ago,&#160;people would find a decent person who lived in&#160;their neighborhood. Their families would meet&#160;and, after deciding neither party seemed like a&#160;murderer, they would get married and soon have&#160;a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today,&#160;people marry later than ever and spend years of&#160;their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a&#160;soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his&#160;comic insight at modern romance, but for Modern&#160;Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take&#160;things to another level. He teamed up with NYU&#160;sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive&#160;research project, including hundreds of interviews&#160;and focus groups conducted everywhere from&#160;Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed&#160;behavioral data and surveys and created their own&#160;online research forum on Reddit, which drew&#160;thousands of messages. They enlisted the world&#8217;s&#160;leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen&#160;Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry&#160;Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any&#160;social science or humor book we&#8217;ve seen before.In Modern Romance, Ansari combines his&#160;irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science&#160;to give us an unforgettable tour of our new&#160;romantic world. ...more</description><upc>caf4fe9311f1dc59</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>28.26</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>28.26</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Add a comment</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b75f6</_id><title>Library of Souls (Miss Peregrine&#8217;s Peculiar Children #3)</title><price>48.56</price><availability>In stock (15 available)</availability><description>A boy with extraordinary powers.

The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn&#8217;t published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books, but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel.Morris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later, a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he&#8217;s released from prison after thirty-five years.Not since Misery has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous.

Together with inker Klaus Janson and colorist Lynn Varley, writer/artist Frank Miller completely reinvents the legend of Batman in his saga of a near-future Gotham City gone to rot, ten years after the Dark Knight's retirement. Crime runs rampant in the streets, and the man who was Batman is still tortured by the memories of his parents' murders. As civil society crumbles around him, Bruce Wayne's long-suppressed vigilante side finally breaks free of its self-imposed shackles. The Dark Knight returns in a blaze of fury, taking on a whole new generation of criminals and matching their level of violence. He is soon joined by this generation's Robin &#8212; a girl named Carrie Kelley, who proves to be just as invaluable as her predecessors.But can Batman and Robin deal with the threat posed by their deadliest enemies, after years of incarceration have made them into perfect psychopaths? And more important, can anyone survive the coming fallout of an undeclared war between the superpowers - or a clash of what were once the world's greatest superheroes?Over fifteen years after its debut, 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns' remains an undisputed classic and one of the most influential stories ever told in the comics medium.Collecting BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS #1-4 ...more</description><upc>47271d8e08b5d31c</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>15.38</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>15.38</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Sequential Art</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b7613</_id><title>Amatus</title><price>50.54</price><availability>In stock (15 available)</availability><description>Crispian, who has lived in a city of darkness all his life, must make a choice: remain safe in his home, but forever wonder what the mysterious light on the horizon could be--or trust a young woman to guide him to a wonderful realm he's never seen, and risk being deceived and led to a terrible death.</description><upc>ffd54178acc9a6a5</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>50.54</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>50.54</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Default</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b7614</_id><title>Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto</title><price>12.51</price><availability>In stock (15 available)</availability><description>A widely admired writer on religion celebrates agnosticism as the most vibrant, engaging&#8212;and ultimately the most honest&#8212;stance toward the mysteries of existence.

One in four Americans reject any affiliation with organized religion, and nearly half of those under thirty describe themselves as &#8220;spiritual but not religious.&#8221; But as the airwaves resound with the haranguing of preachers and pundits, who speaks for the millions who find no joy in whittling the wonder of existence to a simple yes/no choice? Lesley Hazleton does. In this provocative, brilliant book, she gives voice to the case for agnosticism, breaks it free of its stereotypes as watered-down atheism or amorphous &#8220;seeking,&#8221; and celebrates it as a reasoned, revealing, and sustaining stance toward life. Stepping over the lines imposed by rigid conviction, she draws on philosophy, theology, psychology, science, and more to explore, with curiosity and passion, the vital role of mystery in a deceptively information-rich world; to ask what we mean by the search for meaning; to invoke the humbling yet elating perspective of infinity; to challenge received ideas about death; and to reconsider what &#8220;the soul&#8221; might be. Inspired and inspiring, Agnostic&#160;recasts the question of belief not as a problem to be solved but as an invitation to an ongoing, open-ended adventure of the mind. ...more</description><upc>d195e7f4ed697350</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>12.51</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>12.51</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Nonfiction</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b7616</_id><title>You (You #1)</title><price>43.61</price><availability>In stock (14 available)</availability><description>When a beautiful, aspiring writer strides into the East Village bookstore where Joe Goldberg works, he does what anyone would do: he Googles the name on her credit card.There is only one Guinevere Beck in New York City.

In "Greek Mythic History," he weaves myths concerning gods, kings, and heroes into their intended time and place and offers a concise retelling of Greek myths from a historic perspective. Capitalizing on modern discoveries, Clevenger tells the story in chronological order, starting with the creation of the cosmos and ending in the Dark Ages when poets began to write down their myths and stories. Neither history nor mythology, the stories depict what history might be if the myths were interpreted more literally.With maps and exhibits included, "Greek Mythic History" provides a comprehensive retelling of the various Hellenic myths in a logical historical sequence, and places nearly the entire canon into context. ...more</description><upc>f201f263d8c23f97</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>10.23</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>10.23</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Default</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b766d</_id><title>God: The Most Unpleasant Character in All Fiction</title><price>30.03</price><availability>In stock (14 available)</availability><description>What words come to mind when we think of God?

Norman Bates is in the State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and it's up to Dr. Felix Reed to bring him out of his catatonic state.But Norman and Dr. Reed have obstacles in twisted fellow patients and staff members who think of the institution as a prison rather than a place of healing.

Yet when Richard has a problem, he turns to his valet, a fixer of unparalleled genius&#8212;and the object of Richard&#8217;s deepest desires. If there is one rule a gentleman must follow, it is never to dally with servants. But when David is close enough to touch, the rules of class collide with the basest sort of animal instinct: overpowering lust. &#160; For David Cyprian, burglary and blackmail are as much in a day&#8217;s work as bootblacking&#8212;anything for the man he&#8217;s devoted to.

She has written to say she is in hospice and wanted to say goodbye. Leaving his tense, bitter wife Maureen to her chores, Harold intends a quick walk to the corner mailbox to post his reply but instead, inspired by a chance encounter, he becomes convinced he must deliver his message in person to Queenie--who is 600 miles away--because as long as he keeps walking, Harold believes that Queenie will not die.

Kill &#8217;Em National Book Award winner James McBride goes in search of the &#8220;real&#8221; James Brown after receiving a tip that promises to uncover the man behind the myth. His surprising journey illuminates not only our understanding of this immensely troubled, misunderstood, and complicated soul genius but the ways in which our cultural heritage has been shaped by Brown&#8217;s legacy. &#160;Kill &#8217;Em and Leave is more than a book about James Brown. Brown&#8217;s rough-and-tumble life, through McBride&#8217;s lens, is an unsettling metaphor for American life: the tension between North and South, black and white, rich and poor. McBride&#8217;s travels take him to forgotten corners of Brown&#8217;s never-before-revealed history: the country town where Brown&#8217;s family and thousands of others were displaced by America&#8217;s largest nuclear power bomb-making facility; a South Carolina field where a long-forgotten cousin recounts, in the dead of night, a fuller history of Brown&#8217;s sharecropping childhood, which until now has been a mystery. McBride seeks out the American expatriate in England who co-created the James Brown sound, visits the trusted right-hand manager who worked with Brown for forty-one years, and interviews Brown&#8217;s most influential nonmusical creation, his &#8220;adopted son,&#8221; the Reverend Al Sharpton. He describes the stirring visit of Michael Jackson to the Augusta, Georgia, funeral home where the King of Pop sat up all night with the body of his musical godfather, spends hours talking with Brown&#8217;s first wife, and lays bare the Dickensian legal contest over James Brown&#8217;s estate, a fight that has consumed careers; prevented any money from reaching the poor schoolchildren in Georgia and South Carolina, as instructed in his will; cost Brown&#8217;s estate millions in legal fees; and left James Brown&#8217;s body to lie for more than eight years in a gilded coffin in his daughter&#8217;s yard in South Carolina. &#160; James McBride is one of the most distinctive and electric literary voices in America today, and&#160;part of the pleasure of his narrative is being in his presence, coming to understand Brown through McBride&#8217;s own insights as a black musician with Southern roots.&#160;Kill &#8217;Em and Leave is a song unearthing and celebrating James Brown&#8217;s great legacy: the cultural landscape of America today.Praise for Kill &#8217;Em and Leave &#8220;The definitive look at one of the greatest, most important entertainers, The Godfather, Da Number One Soul Brother, Mr. Please, Please Himself&#8212;JAMES BROWN.&#8221;&#8212;Spike Lee &#8220;Please, please, please: Can anybody tell us who and what was James Brown?

Lauded as the most articulate voice of American freedom and equality, even as he held people&#8212;including his own family&#8212;in bondage, Jefferson is variably described as a hypocrite, an atheist, or a simple-minded proponent of limited government who expected all Americans to be farmers forever.Now, Annette Gordon-Reed teams up with America's leading Jefferson scholar, Peter S. Onuf, to present an absorbing and revealing character study that dispels the many clich&#233;s that have accrued over the years about our third president. Challenging the widely prevalent belief that Jefferson remains so opaque as to be unknowable, the authors&#8212;through their careful analysis, painstaking research, and vivid prose&#8212;create a portrait of Jefferson, as he might have painted himself, one "comprised of equal parts sun and shadow" (Jane Kamensky).Tracing Jefferson's philosophical development from youth to old age, the authors explore what they call the "empire" of Jefferson's imagination&#8212;an expansive state of mind born of his origins in a slave society, his intellectual influences, and the vaulting ambition that propelled him into public life as a modern avatar of the Enlightenment who, at the same time, likened himself to a figure of old&#8212;"the most blessed of the patriarchs." Indeed, Jefferson saw himself as a "patriarch," not just to his country and mountain-like home at Monticello but also to his family, the white half that he loved so publicly, as well as to the black side that he claimed to love, a contradiction of extraordinary historical magnitude.Divided into three sections, "Most Blessed of the Patriarchs" reveals a striking personal dimension to his life. Part I,&#160;"Patriarch," explores Jeffersons's origins in Virgina; Part II, " 'Traveller,' " covers his five-year sojourn to Paris; and Part III, "Enthusiast," delves insightfully into the Virginian's views on Christianity, slavery, and race. We see not just his ideas and vision of America but come to know him in an almost familial way, such as through the importance of music in his life."Most Blessed of the Patriarchs" fundamentally challenges much of what we&#8217;ve come to accept about Jefferson, neither hypocrite nor saint, atheist nor fundamentalist. Gordon-Reed and Onuf, through a close reading of Jefferson&#8217;s own words, reintroduce us all to our most influential founding father: a man more gifted than most, but complicated in just the ways we all are. ...more</description><upc>f16c2edb2a603f92</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>44.48</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>44.48</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>History</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b772c</_id><title>What Happened on Beale Street (Secrets of the South Mysteries #2)</title><price>25.37</price><availability>In stock (7 available)</availability><description>What Happened on Beale Street is an exciting addition to the Secrets of the South Mysteries from bestselling author Mary Ellis.

Do we need another Lincoln biography? In Team of Rivals, esteemed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin proves that we do. Though she can't help but cover some familiar territory, her perspective is focused enough to offer fresh insights into Lincoln's leadership style and his deep understanding of human behavior and motivation. Goodwin makes the case for Lincoln's political genius by examining his relationships with three men he selected for his cabinet, all of whom were opponents for the Republican nomination in 1860: William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, and Edward Bates. These men, all accomplished, nationally known, and presidential, originally disdained Lincoln for his backwoods upbringing and lack of experience, and were shocked and humiliated at losing to this relatively obscure Illinois lawyer. Yet Lincoln not only convinced them to join his administration--Seward as secretary of state, Chase as secretary of the treasury, and Bates as attorney general--he ultimately gained their admiration and respect as well. How he soothed egos, turned rivals into allies, and dealt with many challenges to his leadership, all for the sake of the greater good, is largely what Goodwin's fine book is about. Had he not possessed the wisdom and confidence to select and work with the best people, she argues, he could not have led the nation through one of its darkest periods. Ten years in the making, this engaging work reveals why "Lincoln's road to success was longer, more tortuous, and far less likely" than the other men, and why, when opportunity beckoned, Lincoln was "the best prepared to answer the call." This multiple biography further provides valuable background and insights into the contributions and talents of Seward, Chase, and Bates. Lincoln may have been "the indispensable ingredient of the Civil War," but these three men were invaluable to Lincoln and they played key roles in keeping the nation intact. --Shawn Carkonen Team of Rivals doesn't just tell the story of Abraham Lincoln. It is a multiple biography of the entire team of personal and political competitors that he put together to lead the country through its greatest crisis. Here, Doris Kearns Goodwin profiles five of the key players in her book, four of whom contended for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination and all of whom later worked together in Lincoln's cabinet.1. Edwin M. StantonStanton treated Lincoln with utter contempt at their initial acquaintance when the two men were involved in a celebrated law case in the summer of 1855. Unimaginable as it might seem after Stanton's demeaning behavior, Lincoln offered him "the most powerful civilian post within his gift"--the post of secretary of war--at their next encounter six years later. On his first day in office as Simon Cameron's replacement, the energetic, hardworking Stanton instituted "an entirely new regime" in the War Department. After nearly a year of disappointment with Cameron, Lincoln had found in Stanton the leader the War Department desperately needed. Lincoln's choice of Stanton revealed his singular ability to transcend personal vendetta, humiliation, or bitterness. As for Stanton, despite his initial contempt for the man he once described as a "long armed Ape," he not only accepted the offer but came to respect and love Lincoln more than any person outside of his immediate family. He was beside himself with grief for weeks after the president's death.2. Salmon P. ChaseChase, an Ohioan, had been both senator and governor, had played a central role in the formation of the national Republican Party, and had shown an unflagging commitment to the cause of the black man. No individual felt he deserved the presidency as a natural result of his past contributions more than Chase himself, but he refused to engage in the practical methods by which nominations are won. He had virtually no campaign and he failed to conciliate his many enemies in Ohio itself. As a result, he alone among the candidates came to the convention without the united support of his own state. Chase never ceased to underestimate Lincoln, nor to resent the fact that he had lost the presidency to a man he considered his inferior. His frustration with his position as secretary of the treasury was alleviated only by his his dogged hope that he, rather than Lincoln, would be the Republican nominee in 1864, and he steadfastly worked to that end. The president put up with Chase's machinations and haughty yet fundamentally insecure nature because he recognized his superlative accomplishments at treasury. Eventually, however, Chase threatened to split the Republican Party by continuing to fill key positions with partisans who supported his presidential hopes. When Lincoln stepped in, Chase tendered his resignation as he had three times before, but this time Lincoln stunned Chase by calling his bluff and accepting the offer.3. Abraham Lincoln When Lincoln won the Republican presidential nomination in 1860 he seemed to have come from nowhere--a backwoods lawyer who had served one undistinguished term in the House of Representatives and lost two consecutive contests for the U.S. Senate. Contemporaries attributed his surprising nomination to chance, to his moderate position on slavery, and to the fact that he hailed from the battleground state of Illinois. But Lincoln's triumph, particularly when viewed against the efforts of his rivals, owed much to a remarkable, unsuspected political acuity and an emotional strength forged in the crucible of hardship and defeat. That Lincoln, after winning the presidency, made the unprecedented decision to incorporate his eminent rivals into his political family, the cabinet, was evidence of an uncanny self-confidence and an indication of what would prove to others a most unexpected greatness.4. William H. Seward A celebrated senator from New York for more than a decade and governor of his state for two terms before going to Washington, Seward was certain he was going to receive his party's nomination for president in 1860. The weekend before the convention in Chicago opened he had already composed a first draft of the valedictory speech he expected to make to the Senate, assuming that he would resign his position as soon as the decision in Chicago was made. His mortification at not having received the nomination never fully abated, and when he was offered his cabinet post as secretary of state he intended to have a major role in choosing the remaining cabinet members, conferring upon himself a position in the new government more commanding than that of Lincoln himself. He quickly realized the futility of his plan to relegate the president to a figurehead role. Though the feisty New Yorker would continue to debate numerous issues with Lincoln in the years ahead, exactly as Lincoln had hoped and needed him to do, Seward would become his closest friend, advisor, and ally in the administration. More than any other cabinet member Seward appreciated Lincoln's peerless skill in balancing factions both within his administration and in the country at large.5. Edward Bates A widely respected elder statesman, a delegate to the convention that framed the Missouri Constitution, and a former Missouri congressman whose opinions on national matters were still widely sought, Bates's ambitions for political success were gradually displaced by love for his wife and large family, and he withdrew from public life in the late 1840s. For the next 20 years he was asked repeatedly to run or once again accept high government posts but he consistently declined. However in early 1860, with letters and newspaper editorials advocating his candidacy crowding in upon him, he decided to try for the highest office in the land. After losing to Lincoln he vowed, in his diary, to decline a cabinet position if one were to be offered, but with the country "in trouble and danger" he felt it was his duty to accept when Lincoln asked him to be attorney general. Though Bates initially viewed Lincoln as a well-meaning but incompetent administrator, he eventually concluded that the president was an unmatched leader, "very near being a 'perfect man.'" ...more</description><upc>ba047a636b7d3793</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>20.12</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>20.12</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Add a comment</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b7747</_id><title>Naturally Lean: 125 Nourishing Gluten-Free, Plant-Based Recipes--All Under 300 Calories</title><price>11.38</price><availability>In stock (7 available)</availability><description>When you're hungry for a filling meal, it's easy to go for the unhealthy stuff.

Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world&#8217;s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining. ...more</description><upc>6c7fa6844380f50a</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>52.4</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>52.4</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>History</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b775f</_id><title>The Sound Of Love</title><price>57.84</price><availability>In stock (6 available)</availability><description>Born and raised on her family farm in rural East Tennessee, Danielle Adams always dreamed of moving to Nashville&#8212;known in her family as the &#8220;big city&#8221;.

William Geroux has unearthed a fascinating tale of one small coastal town caught in the thick of the fight, and he tells it with a sharp reporter&#8217;s eye and a real feel for the heroic men who went down to the sea in ships.&#8221; &#8212;Evan Thomas, author of Being Nixon and Sea of ThunderMathews County, Virginia, is a remote outpost on the Chesapeake Bay with little to offer except unspoiled scenery&#8212;but it sent one of the largest concentrations of sea captains and U.S. merchant mariners of any community in America to fight in World War II. The Mathews Men tells that heroic story through the experiences of one extraordinary family whose seven sons (and their neighbors), U.S. merchant mariners all, suddenly found themselves squarely in the cross-hairs of the U-boats bearing down on the coastal United States in 1942. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; From the late 1930s to 1945, virtually all the fuel, food and munitions that sustained the Allies in Europe traveled not via the Navy but in merchant ships. After Pearl Harbor, those unprotected ships instantly became the U-boats&#8217; prime targets. And they were easy targets&#8212;the Navy lacked the inclination or resources to defend them until the beginning of 1943. Hitler was determined that his U-boats should sink every American ship they could find, sometimes within sight of tourist beaches, and to kill as many mariners as possible, in order to frighten their shipmates into staying ashore. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As the war progressed, men from Mathews sailed the North and South Atlantic, the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and even the icy Barents Sea in the Arctic Circle, where they braved the dreaded Murmansk Run. Through their experiences we have eyewitnesses to every danger zone, in every kind of ship. Some died horrific deaths. Others fought to survive torpedo explosions, flaming oil slicks, storms, shark attacks, mine blasts, and harrowing lifeboat odysseys&#8212;only to ship out again on the next boat as soon as they'd returned to safety.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Mathews Men shows us the war far beyond traditional battlefields&#8212;often the U.S. merchant mariners&#8217; life-and-death struggles took place just off the U.S. coast&#8212;but also takes us to the landing beaches at D-Day and to the Pacific. &#8220;When final victory is ours,&#8221; General Dwight D. Eisenhower had predicted, &#8220;there is no organization that will share its credit more deservedly than the Merchant Marine.&#8221; Here, finally, is the heroic story of those merchant seamen, recast as the human story of the men from Mathews. ...more</description><upc>0d210d2448c3018f</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>42.91</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>42.91</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>History</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b7794</_id><title>The False Prince (The Ascendance Trilogy #1)</title><price>56.0</price><availability>In stock (5 available)</availability><description>The False Prince is the thrilling first book in a brand-new trilogy filled with danger and deceit and hidden identities that will have readers rushing breathlessly to the end.In a discontent kingdom, civil war is brewing.

Though many have tried to replicate Stoker's horror classic&#8212;in books, television shows, and movies&#8212;only the 1931 Bela Lugosi film bore the Stoker family's support. Until now. Dracula The Un-Dead is a bone-chilling sequel based on Bram Stoker's own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition. Dracula The Un-Dead begins in 1912, twenty-five years after Dracula "crumbled into dust." Van Helsing's prot&#233;g&#233;, Dr. Jack Seward, is now a disgraced morphine addict obsessed with stamping out evil across Europe. Meanwhile, an unknowing Quincey Harker, the grown son of Jonathan and Mina, leaves law school for the London stage, only to stumble upon the troubled production of "Dracula," directed and produced by Bram Stoker himself. The play plunges Quincey into the world of his parents' terrible secrets, but before he can confront them he experiences evil in a way he had never imagined. One by one, the band of heroes that defeated Dracula a quarter-century ago is being hunted down. Could it be that Dracula somehow survived their attack and is seeking revenge? Or is there another force at work whose relentless purpose is to destroy anything and anyone associated with Dracula? Dracula The Un-Dead is deeply researched, rich in character, thrills and scares, and lovingly crafted as both an extension and celebration of one of the most classic popular novels in literature. ...more</description><upc>e46b1074b99ac4b6</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>35.63</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>35.63</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Horror</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b77b5</_id><title>Digital Fortress</title><price>58.0</price><availability>In stock (5 available)</availability><description>Before the multi-million, runaway bestseller The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown set his razor-sharp research and storytelling skills on the most powerful intelligence organization on earth--the National Security Agency (NSA), an ultra-secret, multibillion-dollar agency many times more powerful than the CIA.When the NSA's invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious c Before the multi-million, runaway bestseller The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown set his razor-sharp research and storytelling skills on the most powerful intelligence organization on earth--the National Security Agency (NSA), an ultra-secret, multibillion-dollar agency many times more powerful than the CIA.When the NSA's invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant and beautiful mathematician.

And why is gallium (Ga, 31) the go-to element for laboratory pranksters?*The Periodic Table is a crowning scientific achievement, but it's also a treasure trove of adventure, betrayal, and obsession. These fascinating tales follow every element on the table as they play out their parts in human history, and in the lives of the (frequently) mad scientists who discovered them. THE DISAPPEARING SPOON masterfully fuses science with the classic lore of invention, investigation, and discovery--from the Big Bang through the end of time. *Though solid at room temperature, gallium is a moldable metal that melts at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. A classic science prank is to mold gallium spoons, serve them with tea, and watch guests recoil as their utensils disappear. ...more</description><upc>63c0826ef59eae66</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>57.35</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>57.35</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Science</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b7835</_id><title>The Day the Crayons Came Home (Crayons)</title><price>26.33</price><availability>In stock (3 available)</availability><description>The companion to the #1 blockbuster bestseller, The Day the Crayons Quit!

And The Book of Basketball is that book. Nowhere in the roundball universe will you find another single volume that covers as much in such depth as this wildly opinionated and thoroughly entertaining look at the past, present, and future of pro basketball.From the age-old question of who actually won the rivalry between Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain to the one about which team was truly the best of all time, Simmons opens&#8211;and then closes, once and for all&#8211;every major pro basketball debate. Then he takes it further by completely reevaluating not only how NBA Hall of Fame inductees should be chosen but how the institution must be reshaped from the ground up, the result being the Pyramid: Simmons&#8217;s one-of-a-kind, five-level shrine to the ninety-six greatest players in the history of pro basketball. And ultimately he takes fans to the heart of it all, as he uses a conversation with one NBA great to uncover that coveted thing: The Secret of Basketball.Comprehensive, authoritative, controversial, hilarious, and impossible to put down (even for Celtic-haters), The Book of Basketball offers every hardwood fan a courtside seat beside the game&#8217;s finest, funniest, and fiercest chronicler.* More to the point, he&#8217;s the only one crazy enough to try to pull it off. ...more</description><upc>08decd9664e5d56e</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>44.84</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>44.84</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Sports and Games</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b783f</_id><title>The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game</title><price>53.71</price><availability>In stock (3 available)</availability><description>When we first meet Michael Oher is one of thirteen children by a mother addicted to crack; he does not know his real name, his father, his birthday, or how to read or write.

G On one side, there is Grace: prize-winning author Diana Abu-Jaber&#8217;s tough, independent sugar-fiend of a German grandmother, wielding a suitcase full of holiday cookies. On the other, Bud: a flamboyant, spice-obsessed Arab father, full of passionate argument. The two could not agree on anything: not about food, work, or especially about what Diana should do with her life. Grace warned her away from children. Bud wanted her married above all&#8212;even if he had to provide the ring. Caught between cultures and lavished with contradictory &#8220;advice&#8221; from both sides of her family, Diana spent years learning how to ignore others&#8217; well-intentioned prescriptions.Hilarious, gorgeously written, poignant, and wise, Life Without a Recipe is Diana&#8217;s celebration of journeying without a map, of learning to ignore the script and improvise, of escaping family and making family on one&#8217;s own terms. As Diana discovers, however, building confidence in one&#8217;s own path sometimes takes a mistaken marriage or two&#8212;or in her case, three: to a longhaired boy-poet, to a dashing deconstructionist literary scholar, and finally to her steadfast, outdoors-loving Scott. It also takes a good deal of angst (was it possible to have a serious writing career and be a mother?) and, even when she knew what she wanted (the craziest thing, in one&#8217;s late forties: a baby!), the nerve to pursue it.Finally, fearlessly independent like the Grace she&#8217;s named after, Diana and Scott&#8217;s daughter Gracie will heal all the old battles with Bud and, like her writer-mom, learn to cook up a life without a recipe. ...more</description><upc>c53d9fefcda371e9</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>59.04</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>59.04</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Autobiography</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b7870</_id><title>Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal</title><price>55.5</price><availability>In stock (3 available)</availability><description>The birth of Jesus has been well chronicled, as have his glorious teachings, acts, and divine sacrifice after his thirtieth birthday.

Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a party of moose hunters. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and , unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild. ...more</description><upc>a7c3f1010d64799a</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>56.7</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>56.7</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Nonfiction</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b7876</_id><title>Inferno (Robert Langdon #4)</title><price>41.0</price><availability>In stock (3 available)</availability><description>In his international blockbusters The Da Vinci Code, Angels &amp; Demons, and The Lost Symbol, Dan Brown masterfully fused history, art, codes, and symbols.

Lyons has injected a dose of sanity into a world gone mad." ---Ashlee Vance, New York Times-bestselling author of Elon MuskFor twenty-five years Dan Lyons was a magazine writer at the top of his profession--until one Friday morning when he received a phone call: Poof. His job no longer existed. "I think they just want to hire younger people," his boss at Newsweek told him. Fifty years old and with a wife and two young kids, Dan was, in a word, screwed. Then an idea hit. Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley and the tech explosion. Why not join it? HubSpot, a Boston start-up, was flush with $100 million in venture capital. They offered Dan a pile of stock options for the vague role of "marketing fellow." What could go wrong? HubSpotters were true believers: They were making the world a better place ... by selling email spam. The office vibe was frat house meets cult compound: The party began at four thirty on Friday and lasted well into the night; "shower pods" became hook-up dens; a push-up club met at noon in the lobby, while nearby, in the "content factory," Nerf gun fights raged. Groups went on "walking meetings," and Dan's absentee boss sent cryptic emails about employees who had "graduated" (read: been fired). In the middle of all this was Dan, exactly twice the age of the average HubSpot employee, and literally old enough to be the father of most of his co-workers, sitting at his desk on his bouncy-ball "chair."Mixed in with Lyons's uproarious tale of his rise and fall at Hubspot is a trenchant analysis of the start-up world, a de facto conspiracy between those who start companies and those who fund them, a world where bad ideas are rewarded with hefty investments, where companies blow money lavishing perks on their post-collegiate workforces, and where everybody is trying to hang on just long enough to reach an IPO and cash out. With a cast of characters that includes devilish angel investors, fad-chasing venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and "wantrapreneurs," bloggers and brogrammers, social climbers and sociopaths, Disrupted is a gripping and definitive account of life in the (second) tech bubble. ...more</description><upc>81372abc86f65c79</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>15.28</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>15.28</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Nonfiction</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b7893</_id><title>Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania</title><price>39.24</price><availability>In stock (3 available)</availability><description>#1 New York Times BestsellerFrom thebestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the LusitaniaOn May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passeng #1 New York Times BestsellerFrom the&#160;bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the LusitaniaOn May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era&#8217;s great transatlantic &#8220;Greyhounds&#8221;&#8212;the fastest liner then in service&#8212;and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack.&#160;Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger&#8217;s U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small&#8212;hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more&#8212;all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but don&#8217;t, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love.&#160; Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history. ...more</description><upc>04d858cdeeee0da4</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>39.24</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>39.24</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Default</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b7896</_id><title>Dark Places</title><price>23.9</price><availability>In stock (3 available)</availability><description>FROM THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF GONE GIRLLibby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in &#8220;The Satan Sacrifice" of Kinnakee, Kansas.&#8221; She survived&#8212;and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer.

What she doesn't know is that Nick's family home happens to look like a palace, that she'll ride in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's most eligible bachelors on her arm, Rachel might as well have a target on her back. Initiated into a world of dynastic splendor beyond imagination, Rachel meets Astrid, the It Girl of Singapore society; Eddie, whose family practically lives in the pages of the Hong Kong socialite magazines; and Eleanor, Nick's formidable mother, a woman who has very strong feelings about who her son should--and should not--marry. Uproarious, addictive, and filled with jaw-dropping opulence, Crazy Rich Asians is an insider's look at the Asian JetSet; a perfect depiction of the clash between old money and new money; between Overseas Chinese and Mainland Chinese; and a fabulous novel about what it means to be young, in love, and gloriously, crazily rich. ...more</description><upc>c9782ad2a0ed9331</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>49.13</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>49.13</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Fiction</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b789e</_id><title>Breaking Dawn (Twilight #4)</title><price>35.28</price><availability>In stock (3 available)</availability><description>When you loved the one who was killing you, it left you no options.

Why are some peopl In his landmark bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.ContentsIntroduction: The statue that didn&#180;t look right1.

For starters, there's a good bit of staggering genius before you even get to the true story, including a preface, a list of "Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book," and a 20-page ack Dave Eggers is a terrifically talented writer; don't hold his cleverness against him. What to make of a book called A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: Based on a True Story? For starters, there's a good bit of staggering genius before you even get to the true story, including a preface, a list of "Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book," and a 20-page acknowledgements section complete with special mail-in offer, flow chart of the book's themes, and a lovely pen-and-ink drawing of a stapler (helpfully labeled "Here is a drawing of a stapler:"). But on to the true story. At the age of 22, Eggers became both an orphan and a "single mother" when his parents died within five months of one another of unrelated cancers. In the ensuing sibling division of labor, Dave is appointed unofficial guardian of his 8-year-old brother, Christopher. The two live together in semi-squalor, decaying food and sports equipment scattered about, while Eggers worries obsessively about child-welfare authorities, molesting babysitters, and his own health. His child-rearing strategy swings between making his brother's upbringing manically fun and performing bizarre developmental experiments on him. (Case in point: his idea of suitable bedtime reading is John Hersey's Hiroshima.) The book is also, perhaps less successfully, about being young and hip and out to conquer the world (in an ironic, media-savvy, Gen-X way, naturally). In the early '90s, Eggers was one of the founders of the very funny Might Magazine, and he spends a fair amount of time here on Might, the hipster culture of San Francisco's South Park, and his own efforts to get on to MTV's Real World. This sort of thing doesn't age very well--but then, Eggers knows that. There's no criticism you can come up with that he hasn't put into A.H.W.O.S.G. already. "The book thereafter is kind of uneven," he tells us regarding the contents after page 109, and while that's true, it's still uneven in a way that is funny and heartfelt and interesting. All this self-consciousness could have become unbearably arch. It's a testament to Eggers's skill as a writer--and to the heartbreaking particulars of his story--that it doesn't. Currently the editor of the footnote-and-marginalia-intensive journal McSweeney's (the last issue featured an entire story by David Foster Wallace printed tinily on its spine), Eggers comes from the most media-saturated generation in history--so much so that he can't feel an emotion without the sense that it's already been felt for him. What may seem like postmodern noodling is really just Eggers writing about pain in the only honest way available to him. Oddly enough, the effect is one of complete sincerity, and--especially in its concluding pages--this memoir as metafiction is affecting beyond all rational explanation. --Mary Park ...more</description><upc>c9770bb1d5a492a0</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>54.29</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>54.29</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Autobiography</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b78be</_id><title>Life</title><price>31.58</price><availability>In stock (2 available)</availability><description>With the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards created the riffs, the lyrics and the songs that roused the world, and over four decades he lived the original rock and roll life.

An experienced falconer, Helen had never before been tempted to train one of the most vicious predators, the goshawk, but in her grief, she saw that the goshawk's fierce and feral temperament mirrored her own. Resolving to purchase and raise the deadly creature as a means to cope with her loss, she adopted Mabel, and turned to the guidance of The Once and Future King author T.H. White's chronicle The Goshawk to begin her challenging endeavor. Projecting herself "in the hawk's wild mind to tame her" tested the limits of Macdonald's humanity and changed her life.Heart-wrenching and humorous, this book is an unflinching account of bereavement and a unique look at the magnetism of an extraordinary beast, with a parallel examination of a legendary writer's eccentric falconry. Obsession, madness, memory, myth, and history combine to achieve a distinctive blend of nature writing and memoir from an outstanding literary innovator. ...more</description><upc>b6d3f4f4ee1f6069</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>57.42</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>57.42</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Nonfiction</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b78c2</_id><title>Fruits Basket, Vol. 2 (Fruits Basket #2)</title><price>11.64</price><availability>In stock (2 available)</availability><description>A family with an ancient curse...And the girl who will change their lives forever...Ever since Tohru Honda discovered the Zodiac secret of the Sohma clan, her eyes have opened to a world of magic and wonder.

To reassure An intimate journey across and in search of America, as told by one of its most beloved writers, in a deluxe centennial edition In September 1960, John Steinbeck embarked on a journey across America. He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante. &#160; His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York. &#160;Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life&#8212;a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography.

In this short book, he provides readers with a fictional account of how a real, new medical technology could revolutionize the future of medicine by curing with sound. THE TUMOR follows the present day experience of the fictional patient Paul, an otherwise healthy 35-year-old father who is diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. Grisham takes readers through a detailed account of Paul&#8217;s treatment and his family&#8217;s experience that doesn&#8217;t end as we would hope. Grisham then explores an alternate future, where Paul is diagnosed with the same brain tumor at the same age, but in the year 2025, when a treatment called focused ultrasound is able to extend his life expectancy. Focused ultrasound has the potential to treat not just brain tumors, but many other disorders, including Parkinson&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s, hypertension, and prostate, breast and pancreatic cancer. For more information, you can visit The Focused Ultrasound Foundation&#8217;s website. Here you will find a video of Grisham on the TEDx stage with the Foundation&#8217;s chairman and a Parkinson&#8217;s patient who brings the audience to its feet sharing her incredible story of a focused ultrasound &#8220;miracle.&#8221; Readers will get a taste of the narrative they expect from Grisham, but this short book will also educate and inspire people to be hopeful about the future of medical innovation. ...more</description><upc>6514add13c82b115</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>41.56</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>41.56</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Nonfiction</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book><Book><_id>666c8f095b1f0e44122b78d3</_id><title>The Silent Wife</title><price>12.34</price><availability>In stock (1 available)</availability><description>A chilling psychological thriller about a marriage, a way of life, and how far one woman will go to keep what is rightfully hersJodi and Todd are at a bad place in their marriage.

Sacred ruins, grand hotels, wildlife preserves, hilltop villages, snack shacks, castles, festivals, reefs, restaurants, cathedrals, hidden islands, opera houses, museums, and more. Each entry tells exactly why it's essential to visit. Then come the nuts and bolts: addresses, websites, phone and fax numbers, best times to visit. Stop dreaming and get going.This hefty volume reminds vacationers that hot tourist spots are small percentage of what's worth seeing out there. A quick sampling: Venice's Cipriani Hotel; California's Monterey Peninsula; the Lewis and Clark Trail in Oregon; the Great Wall of China; Robert Louis Stevenson's home in Western Samoa; and the Alhambra in Andalusia, Spain. Veteran travel guide writer Schultz divides the book geographically, presenting a little less than a page on each location. Each entry lists exactly where to find the spot (e.g. Moorea is located "12 miles/19 km northwest of Tahiti; 10 minutes by air, 1 hour by boat") and when to go (e.g., if you want to check out The Complete Fly Fisher hotel in Montana, "May and Sept.-Oct. offer productive angling in a solitary setting"). This is an excellent resource for the intrepid traveler.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc. ...more</description><upc>228ba5e7577e1d49</upc><product_type>Books</product_type><price_excl_tax>26.08</price_excl_tax><price_incl_tax>26.08</price_incl_tax><tax>0.0</tax><number_of_reviews>0</number_of_reviews><category>Travel</category><star_rating>Five</star_rating></Book></FiveStarBooks></BooksData>
